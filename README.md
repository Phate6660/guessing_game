Created by following the example in the official paperback on Rust programming.

I've added comments and explanations to the code so that anyone who comes across this may be able to follow along.</br>
However, I sincerely suggest you look into the book that this came from.</br>
It's filled with loads of useful info.</br>
[Here's a link](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Covers-2018/dp/1718500440) to where you can buy the book for yourself (**WARNING, IT'S AN AMAZON LINK**).
